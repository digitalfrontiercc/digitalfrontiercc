# Organisations & Projects

**International Commons Projects:**

- [Museum l'internationale](https://internationaleonline.org/about/) - L’Internationale is a confederation of museums, arts organizations and universities that strives to reimagine, re-articulate and practice internationalism, solidarity and communality with respect for our differences.

**Museum of the Commons** - This is the fourth cooperative project led by L’Internationale, focusing on the themes of climate, translocal cooperation, and artistic strategies of healing and repair. ‘Museum of the Commons’ weaves together three transversal thematic threads corresponding to key challenges contemporary societies are facing: Climate, Situated Organisations, Past in the Present.

**Civic Tech:**

- [The Institute for Technology in the Public Interest (TITiPI)](https://titipi.org/) - a trans-practice gathering of activists, artists, engineers and theorists that convene communities to articulate, activate and re-imagine together what computational technologies in the “public interest” might be when “public interest” is always in-the-making.

- [The Engine Room](https://www.theengineroom.org/) - a non-profit organisation with a distributed global team of experienced and committed activists, researchers, technologists and community organisers. Our vision is for social justice movements to use technology and data in safe, responsible and strategic ways, while actively mitigating the vulnerabilities created by digital systems.

- [Team CommUNITY (TCU)](https://www.digitalrights.community/) a community-based membership network that brings together digital defenders from across the globe fighting surveillance, censorship, and other issues sitting at the intersection of human rights and technology.

- [Critical Design Lab](https://www.criticaldesignlab.com/) - centered in disability culture and crip techno-science. Our work pivots around the concept of access: access is our ethic, our creative content, and our methodology. We use digital media and social practice to craft replicable protocols that treat accessibility as research-creation, an aesthetic world-building practice, and an invitation to assemble community.

**Free Software Projects:**

- [Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info/) - a global team who builds and designs easy to use secure apps, open-source software libraries, and customized solutions that can be used around the world by any person or organization looking to protect their communications and data from unjust intrusion, interception and monitoring.

- [Redecentralize](https://redecentralize.org/) an independent, volunteer-driven organisation promoting the decentralisation of our digital technology. By connecting technologists with media, policymakers and the wider public, we support projects that work on open, accountable technologies. We strive for freedom of choice and to reduce the power of, and our collective dependence on, big tech corporations.

- [data.coop](https://data.coop/en/) - a cooperative, which owns and operates a digital infrastructure for its members. Our fundamental vision is to protect our members’ data. The community consists of members around the Copenhagen-area and is open to inquiries from abroad to start sister infrastructures based on the same principles.

- [riseup](https://riseup.net/) - Riseup provides online communication tools for people and groups working on liberatory social change. We are a project to create democratic alternatives and practice self-determination by controlling our own secure means of communications.

- [bitbit](https://bitbit.software/) - Let's leave Big Tech together. Bitbit software is an organisation-in-the-making and sister project of Varia, The Center for Everyday Technology. It was created to help cultural organisations, non-profits and social movements leave Big Tech. Our goal is to promote ways of thinking about and doing digital technology which realise the ideals of Permacomputing.

- [coopcloud.tech](https://coopcloud.tech/) - Co-op Cloud is a software stack that aims to make hosting libre software applications simple for small service providers such as tech co-operatives who are looking to standardise around an open, transparent and scalable infrastructure. It uses the latest container technologies and configurations are shared into the commons for the benefit of all.

- [mur.at](https://mur.at/page/home/) - mur.at enables the networking of diverse art and cultural initiatives in a (shared) virtual space. Similar to university networks that enable collaborative work in the academic field, mur.at is building an infrastructure for the arts.

- [Yanapak](https://yanapak.org/) - Yanapak.org is a self-managed server, a collective tool for generating, distributing, and maintaining digital communication infrastructures in Latin America. We are based on the principles of Freedom, Mutual Aid, and the philosophy of Free Software. We were born from the experience of social movements, unions, students, and independent media collectives. We believe in privacy, and therefore it is essential to have our own communication infrastructures, separate from large corporations. Yanapak means "helper" or "servant" in Kichwa, the second most widely spoken language in the Quechua language family. It is spoken in the Sierra and Oriente of Ecuador, in southwestern Colombia, and in the northern lowland jungle of Peru, and is spoken by approximately 2.5 million people.
