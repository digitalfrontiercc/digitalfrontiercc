Welcome to the digital frontier wiki!

Technology has become more integrated with our daily lives than ever. I know, it's a clich√© saying, but that doesn't make it less true. How do we navigate today's world with technology in a way that is ethical, meaningful, and actually positively influences us? We've seen plenty of examples of how it negatively affects us, and there are most likely many more that you've never even heard of.

This wiki aims to answer two questions:

* how does technology influence us today?
* how can we use technology in an ethical, meaningful, and positive manner?

digitalfrontier.cc's mission is to create a central place for people to learn about our relationschip to technology and media. It's not a place with all answers, instead serving as a compass, guiding individuals toward deeper understanding and critical engagement with technology. For the mission statement, see [[mission_statement]].
