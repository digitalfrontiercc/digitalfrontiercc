Welcome to the digital frontier wiki!

Technology has become more integrated with our daily lives than ever. I know, it's a clich√© saying, but that doesn't make it less true. How do we navigate today's world with technology in a way that is ethical, meaningful, and actually positively influences us? We've seen plenty of examples of how it negatively affects us, and there are most likely many more that you've never even heard of. 

This wiki aims to answer two questions:

* how does technology influence us today?
* how do can we use technology in an ethical, meaningful, and positive manner?

This wiki aims to make a central collection of resources (concepts, movements, and initiatives) on navigating today's digital landscape.

This wiki is brand new. At the moment there aren't many pages to be found, but the hope is to keep building on it to make an expansive catalog.
