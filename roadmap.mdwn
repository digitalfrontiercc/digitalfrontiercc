# Roadmap

According to its [[misschion_statement]], digitalfrontier.cc aims to 'create a central place for people to learn about our relationschip to technology and media'.

Our vision is to realise this with an online platform where one can not only inform themselves, but also ask questions and converse. Similarly, it should be a platform where anyone can contribute to build collective knowledge.

In it's current form, digitalfrontier.cc's tech stack does not allow for this, as it is a static site. We're actively looking at and considering alternative ways to realise the platform, heavily considering collective infrastructure.
